# Unsupervised Learning with Fuzzy Means and Mutual Information

Clustering or cluster analysis involves assigning data points to clusters such that items in the same cluster are as similar as possible, while items belonging to different clusters are as dissimilar as possible. Clusters are identified via similarity measures. These similarity measures include distance, connectivity, and intensity. Different similarity measures may be chosen based on the data or the application.

There are several ways in which an unsupervised problem can be resolved, here I present two techniques and algorithms that deal with resolving unsupervised problems, different algorithms and technques are thaught through this repository and they are.

* Fuzzy Means: Also referred to as soft clustering or soft *k-means* is a form of clustering in which each data point can belong to more than one cluster.

* Mutual Information: Mutual information is a quantity that measures a relationship between two random variables that are sampled simultaneously. In particular, it measures how much information is communicated, on average, in one random variable about another.
